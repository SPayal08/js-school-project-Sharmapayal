Interactive Timeline (Vanilla JS)

This project is a lightweight interactive timeline built with vanilla JavaScript.
It loads event data from a JSON file, renders timeline markers dynamically, and displays event details in a modal.

Features

Event data stored in data/events.json.

At least 8 sample events (fields: year, title, description, imageURL, category).

Dynamically fetches and renders events into the timeline.

Clicking a marker opens a modal with full event details.

Modal can be closed via a "close" button.
